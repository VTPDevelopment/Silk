# Silk! 
Silk is a simple, intuitive and efficient bot created using C# and DSharpPlus Library. Our goal is to create a versatile bot with ease of access for large guilds in mind. Feel free to join our ✊ [support discord](https://discord.gg/d8pk9hK) ✊ to ask any questions you may have or any general support you may need. Oh and while you're at it, you can invite the bot by clicking [here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=721514294587424888&permissions=502656214&scope=bot)

## ⚠️ Development ⚠️
This code is here for development and collaboration purposes, thus we do not provide any support for hosting this bot by yourself. Feel free to do so on your own time.

## Running inside of Docker
To run Silk inside of docker, create a file called `Token.txt` that just includes your Discord bot token.
After that just run `docker-compose up -d`.
